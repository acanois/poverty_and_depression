						For this project, I tried to find a correlation between depression and
						various socio-economic factors. Ultimately, I discovered that it's very
						difficult to find a correlation between depression and anything. I went through
						several different risk factors before settling on poverty level, which had
						the highest correlation at only about 0.3. Employment status, whether employed or
						not, yielded almost no correlation.

						This was the interesting part to me. I thought that depression would be strongly
						correlated to at least one of these factors, but it wasn't.
